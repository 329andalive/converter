# converter
this is a simple converter I wrote using the table in back of a note book. \n 
I posted it for practise with github, and gitbash terminal.\n
I am just learning to program so if anyone has a better way to write this code I would like to see that.\n
I also put a bug in the program so if anyone wanted to fix that it would be a good way to practise using github.
